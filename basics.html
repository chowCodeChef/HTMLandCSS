    <h1> Interneting is easy! </h1>
    <p> First, we need to learn some basic html </p>

    <h2> Lists </h2>
    <p> This is how you make an unordered list </p>

     <ul>
       <li> Add an "ul" element (It stands for unordered list) </li>
       <li> Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
       <li> They can be in any order </li>
     </ul>

     <p> This is what an ordered list looks like </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Alter "ul" to "ol" for an ordered list </li>
       <li> But the list item elements are the same </li>
       <li> Also note how numbers inrement on their own </li>
     </ol>

     <h2>  Inline Elements </h2>
     <p> <em> Sometimes</em> u need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase. Then we need to <em> emphasisie text (usage of inline element "em" for emphasisie)</em></p>
     <p> Other times you need to <strong> strongly </strong> emphasisie a word or a text (usage of inline element "strong")</p>
     <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!! (usage of "em" and "strong" together)</strong></em></p>

     <h2> Empty elements </h2>
     <p> Interneting might be getting easy now! </p>
